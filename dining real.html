            <h2>
                Breeze is Atmosphereâ€™s light and airy all-day dining restaurant.
                Seating up to 90 guests, this food venue is a great place to start
                the day with its spectacular views of the pools, beach and ocean.
                A continental complimentary breakfast is offered from 7am until 9.30am,
                with an all-day menu offered all day until 10pm. With an open show kitchen,
                guests can interact with the chefs whether they are choosing the ingredients
                for their Asian wok or selecting local snapper for the grill. The purpose -built
                wood-fired brick oven cooks the best pizzas on the coast, as well as a variety
                of breads to complement our pastas and salads.
