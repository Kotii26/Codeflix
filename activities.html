            <div>
                <p class="epek1"> Yoga studios and teachers can be found in nearly every corner of the world today and
                    it shouldn’t be hard for most hotel operators to find one to come engage with guests. Hoteliers can
                    offer daily yoga or meditation classes in their hotels to encourage relaxation and improve the
                    overall in-stay experience. </p>

            <img src="yoga class.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Spa services are a great way to provide a luxurious experience to guests while they are
                staying at a hotel property. Whether you have spa amenities on-site or not doesn’t really matter — any
                hotel can partner with local spa services and masseurs to provide special rates and discounts to their
                guests.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="first">
            <h1 class="epek">3. Movie Nights </h1>
            <img src="movie.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Movie nights provide hoteliers with a dual opportunity to boost their bottom lines by
                offering premium snacks and beverages, and improve the overall guest experience at the same time.hotel
                with a lobby has the ability to hold a movie night activity — if you have a conference center, all the
                better — that attracts all kinds of travelers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="first">
            <h1 class="epek">4. Local Tours </h1>
            <img src="water.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">activity packages that include local tour experiences can be a win-win situation for both
                local tour guides and the hotels that provide them. The offering of tour packages and discounts is
                certain to attract guests that are looking to get out and about during their stay and help any type of
                hotel fill their rooms to capacity. </p>

        <div class="first">
            <h1 class="epek"> 5. Bike Rentals</h1>
            <img src="Ebaysikol.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Especially if you’re in an urban or suburban area, low-cost bike rentals are a low-lift way
                for any hotel to impress guests and drive a little extra revenue. Depending on the environment
                surrounding the hotel, you may even want to consider offering multiple types of bikes — mountain, beach
                cruisers, BMX, electric — that will ensure guests have the best experience imaginable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="first">
            <h1 class="epek"> 6. Live Music </h1>
            <img src="songerista.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Hoteliers may want to consider inviting a musician to play music at an open mic night in
                their lobby as a way to provide entertainment to guests at the property, as well as to draw in new
                customers. A musician in the lobby can create a more lively and inviting atmosphere, and can help to
                build a hotel's reputation.</p>

        <div class="first">
            <h1 class="epek">7. Discounted Shopping Trips</h1>
            <img src="groseri.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Partnering with local businesses to offer discounted shopping opportunities can be
                beneficial for hoteliers for a few reasons. First, it gives hotel guests access to discounts that are
                not available anywhere else, thus providing an extra incentive for them to stay at the hotel. Second, it
                provides the hotel with an additional source of revenue.</p>

        <div class="first">
            <h1 class="epek">8. Wine or Local Food Tasting </h1>
            <img src="shot puno.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Some guests would prefer to explore the local area without ever leaving the grounds of a
                hotel. Local wine or food tastings organized on-property present a fantastic opportunity for hoteliers
                to engage their guests in a manner that’s most convenient to them.</p>

            <img src="banana bowt.jpg" class="firstpic">
            <p class="epek1">Make for an adventurous day! Zip-lining through lush landscapes and then cooling off with a
                thrilling ride on a banana boat across the water sounds like an exciting combination of activities.
